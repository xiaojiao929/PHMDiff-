# Multiscale Diffusion Model for Image Synthesis

# Multiscale Diffusion and Autoencoder Model

This repository contains an implementation of a multiscale diffusion model combined with an autoencoder for image synthesis. The model leverages diffusion processes across multiple scales and integrates an autoencoder architecture to enhance the quality of generated images.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the program that sets up the model, handles training, and manages the overall workflow.
- **`autoencoder.py`**: Contains the implementation of the autoencoder used in the model, responsible for encoding and decoding images.
- **`generate.py`**: A script used for generating images using a trained model.
- **`pyramid.py`**: Implements the image pyramid structure used for multiscale processing within the model.
- **`sample.py`**: A utility script for sampling images from the diffusion model.
- **`diffusion_utils.py`**: Provides utility functions that support the diffusion process, including scheduling and step handling.
- **`gaussian_diffusion.py`**: Implements the Gaussian diffusion process, which forms the core of the image generation process.
- **`respace.py`**: Handles resampling techniques used during the diffusion process.
- **`timestep_sampler.py`**: Contains functionality for sampling time steps within the diffusion process.
- **`__init__.py`**: An initialization file for the package, ensuring that the modules can be imported correctly.

## Detailed File Descriptions

### `main.py`
This file is the main script that orchestrates the training of the model. It loads the dataset, sets up the model, defines the training loop, and monitors the training progress. It also manages the saving of model checkpoints and handles any necessary initialization.

### `autoencoder.py`
This module defines the architecture of the autoencoder, which is used to compress and decompress images within the model. The autoencoder consists of an encoder that reduces the dimensionality of the input image and a decoder that reconstructs the image from this compressed representation.

### `generate.py`
This script is used to generate images using a pretrained model. It loads the model weights, performs inference to generate new images, and saves these images to the specified directory. It can also be used to sample multiple images at once.

### `pyramid.py`
This file implements the image pyramid structure, a key component in multiscale processing. The pyramid is used to downsample images to different resolutions, which are then processed separately during the diffusion process. This allows the model to handle features at various scales effectively.

### `sample.py`
`sample.py` provides the functionality to sample images from the diffusion model. It leverages the multiscale pyramid and diffusion processes to generate images iteratively, refining them step by step from coarse to fine resolutions.

### `diffusion_utils.py`
This module contains various utility functions that are crucial for the diffusion process. These include scheduling functions, step size calculations, and noise management. The utilities help streamline the diffusion process, ensuring that each step is executed efficiently.

### `gaussian_diffusion.py`
This is the core module that implements the Gaussian diffusion process. The diffusion process progressively adds and removes noise from images to generate new samples. This file includes the mathematical operations required for forward and reverse diffusion.

### `respace.py`
The `respace.py` file handles resampling techniques, which are used to modify the distribution of time steps during the diffusion process. This can help improve the quality of the generated images by focusing more computation on specific time intervals.

### `timestep_sampler.py`
This module defines the time step sampling strategies used in the diffusion process. It allows the model to sample different time steps in a controlled manner, which is essential for the noise scheduling within the diffusion process.

### `__init__.py`
The `__init__.py` file makes this directory a package, allowing the modules to be imported and used in a cohesive manner.

## Usage

### Training
